# **AlbumTrackr**

**AlbumTrackr** is a powerful application designed to streamline the organization and management of music collections. With full CRUD functionality, users can efficiently manage their music library. AlbumTrackr allows music enthusiasts to maintain a curated and well-organized collection of their favorite albums and songs. <br>
Users can add their songs to the library, watch the music videos directly inside the app, and read the lyrics of the songs they enjoy. This seamless integration enhances the user experience, providing a centralized platform for discovering and engaging with music in various formats.

### MVP Goals
- The app utilizes Django templates for rendering templates to users.
- PostgreSQL is used as the database management system.
- The app uses Django’s built-in session-based authentication.
- Authorization is implemented in the app. Guest users (those not signed in) should not be able to create, update, or delete data in the application or access functionality allowing those actions.
- The app has at least one data entity in addition to the User model. At least one entity must have a relationship with the User model.
- The app has full CRUD functionality.
- The app is deployed online so that the rest of the world can use it.

### Stretch Goals

* Implement functionality that allows the playback of a preview or snippet of a selected song, enabling efficient identification of the track.
* Integrate the capability to upload and display an album cover image, facilitating the visual association of the album with its corresponding cover art.
* Develop a robust search feature for albums and songs, optimizing quick discovery and access based on user input.
* Enable a sharing feature that allows users to share specific songs with others, at their discretion, via social or messaging platforms.
* Register the application with relevant distribution platforms (such as the App Store and Google Play) and with legal entities for intellectual property protection, ensuring that the app’s branding and content are officially registered and legally safeguarded.
